# Changelog

Notable changes to Nuggets, newest first. Each release is a git tag `vX.Y.Z`.

## Unreleased

### Security

- Passkey sign-in refuses a credential id longer than any can be before it reads it. A long
  run of `=` in one held the server for seconds per request.

### Fixed

- The plain-text part of notification emails reads as the email does: apostrophes, `=` and
  © come out as characters, not codes, Outlook-only markup no longer leaves a stray "96",
  and the button's and the unsubscribe link's addresses are in it.
- A screen reader reads the menu's Activity link with its count as "Activity, 2 new"; it
  read "Activity , 2 new", with a pause before the comma.

## 3.0.0 (2026-11-12)

The first public release.
